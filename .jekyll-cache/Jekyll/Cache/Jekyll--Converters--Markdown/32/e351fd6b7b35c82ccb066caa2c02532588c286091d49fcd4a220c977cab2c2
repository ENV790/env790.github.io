<p>This course will help you improve quantitative skills and programming skills. We will learn how to use R to handle data sets, acquire information about the data and fit time series models. <br /></p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is get you machine ready to run R. You may use your own personal computer or choose to use a virtual machine (VM) from Duke’s VCM or a RStudio Container. In this module you will find information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setting up a Virtual Machine;</li>
  <li>Setting up a virtual RStudio container;</li>
  <li>A software installation guide to run R and RStudio for Mac and PC users; and</li>
  <li>How to link RStudio and our class Github repository. If you don’t have prior GitHub experience, you can simply use Github to download code and data. You will not be required to fork and/or clone the class repository.</li>
</ul>
