<p>This course will help you improve quantitative skills and programming skills. We will learn how to use R to handle data sets, to acquire information about the data and to fit time series models. <br /></p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is get you machine ready to run R. You may use your own personal computer or choose to use a virtual machine (VM) from Dukeâ€™s VCM or a RStudio Container. In this module you will find information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setting up your platform;
    <ul>
      <li>Setting up a virtual RStudio container or a Virtual Machine (VM); <br /></li>
      <li>A software installation guide to run R and RStudio for Mac and PC users; and <br /></li>
      <li>How to link RStudio and our class Github repository. If you donâ€™t have prior GitHub experience, you can simply use Github to download code and data. You will not be required to fork and/or clone the class repository. <br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Discuss the basics of Time Series Analysis (TSA): background, motivation, definition, components, etc; <br /></li>
  <li>Go over R and RStudio basics such as how to install packages, importing and exporting data, making plots; <br /></li>
  <li>Introduce best practices on coding: creating well commented scripts, loading packages, adding header. <br /></li>
</ul>
