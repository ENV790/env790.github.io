I"ı<p>Follow these instructions to create your Virtual Machine for the semester.</p>

<h2 id="1-creating-the-vm">1. Creating the VM</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate to Duke‚Äôs Virtual Computing Manager: <a href="https://vcm.duke.edu/">https://vcm.duke.edu/</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Log in. (Multifactor authentication is required‚Ä¶)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Reserve a VM</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the <strong>New Virtual Machine Reservation</strong> list, select <em>Windows Office 2016</em> and click <strong>Reserve</strong>. (Alternatively, click the <em>Available Apps</em> tab, then select the <em>Windows Office 2016</em> option from there‚Ä¶) Accept the Terms of Use and then your VM assembly will begin!</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>It may take some time - up to 30 minutes - for your virtual machine to build. <strong>Please don‚Äôt delete then re-request a machine while waiting for your machine to be built as this will just slow things down more.</strong> An email will be sent to you when the machine is ready to use. Remember that before you can remote desktop into the machine, you‚Äôll need to be using a VPN connection.</em></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong><em>NOTE: I‚Äôve heard reports that build times during peak periods have been in the hours! If you haven‚Äôt received an email stating your machine is ready, then its still building. Canceling and restarting will only increase build times for everyone.</em></strong></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p><em>Note the name of your machine, something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vcm-12345.vm.duke.edu</code>. You can use this to access your machine via remote desktop. Or you can always return to https://vcm.duke.edu/ to log into your machine.</em></p>

      <p><em>Also note that VMs are set to power down every night. This is to conserve power. However, if you are likely to use your machine consecutive days or will have processes running over serval days, you may consider switching off the ‚ÄúAutomatic power downs‚Äù option.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When your machine has been built, click the <strong>Remote Desktop</strong> button. (</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>‚Üí <em>Don‚Äôt forget that you‚Äôll need to use Duke‚Äôs VPN if you are not doing this from a machine already on the campus network!</em></p>

      <p>‚Üí <em>You may wish to save instead of open the remote desktop <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vcm-XXXXX.vm.duke.edu.rdp</code> file. I recommend saving it to your desktop so that you‚Äôll have an easy shortcut to your virtual machine.</em></p>

      <p>‚Üí <em>The first time you use your machine, it may have to download and install a number of Windows updates, requiring a restart to complete. It‚Äôs best to let this happen and restart when asked.</em></p>

      <p>‚Üí <em>If you get a ‚Äúfailed to connect‚Äù error, it‚Äôs possible that your machine is not finished being built. Wait a few more moments; if after 20 minutes or so you still cannot connect, seek help.</em></p>

      <p>‚Üí <em>You may get a warning stating ‚ÄúThe publisher of this remote connection can‚Äôt be identified. Do you want to connect anyway.‚Äù That‚Äôs ok; check the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me again‚Äù and you won‚Äôt get this for this machine anymore.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
