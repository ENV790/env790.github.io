<p>This course will help you improve quantitative skills and programming skills. We will learn how to use R to handle data sets, acquire information about the data and fit models. <br /></p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is get you machine ready to run R. You may use your own personal computer or choose to use a virtual machine (VM) from Dukeâ€™s VCM. In this module you will find information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to reserve and set up a VM;</li>
  <li>A software installation guide to run R and RStudio for Mac and PC users; and</li>
  <li>How to link RStudio and our class Github repository. If you donâ€™t have prior GitHub experience, you can simply use Github to download code and data. You will not be require to fork and/or clone the class repository.</li>

<p>This second video shows the economic impact of having an outage in the old grids and one in the self-healing smart grid. Itâ€™s a 13 minute long video, but itâ€™s very entertaining!</p>
