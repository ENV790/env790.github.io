<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Review of power systems and its four major components: Generation, Transmission, Distribution and Consumption.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understand characteristics of the “old” grids and problems related to reliability, efficiency and environmental impact. When I refer to “old” grids, I am not talking about today’s grid. Old grid is a reference to the power grid before the transition to a smart grid started.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Introduce smart grids: definition, opportunities and challenges.</p>

<p>If want more information on smart grid, watch this animated video from the US Department of Energy entitled “What Is the Smart Grid?”. This is just a first in a chapter of a series os videos on how smart grids impact you.</p>

<p>This second video shows the economic impact of having an outage in the old grids and one in the self-healing smart grid. It’s a 13 minute long video, but it’s very entertaining!</p>
