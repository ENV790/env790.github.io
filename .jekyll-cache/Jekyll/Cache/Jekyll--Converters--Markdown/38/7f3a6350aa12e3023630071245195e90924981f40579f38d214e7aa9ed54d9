<p>In this module we will discuss the changes in electricity distribution from an Information &amp; Comunication Perspective. The module has three learning goals.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discuss smart meters and all the information they are adding to grid operation. Smart meter deployment is the first step to a smarter grid and itâ€™s important to understand how information is transmitted, challenges encountered and how they can enable a smarter energy consumption behavior. <br /></li>
  <li>Discuss end user perspective. How to engage consumer and change their behavior towards sustainability? Whatâ€™s the utility perspective on how electricity distribution will change? New challenges and need for grid adaptation.</li>
  <li>Explore two case studies on smart meter adoption, key findings on smart meter deployment experience in Vermont and Sweden</li>
</ul>
