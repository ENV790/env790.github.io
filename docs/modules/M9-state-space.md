## Learning Objectives

In this module we will talk about the fundamentals of cost allocation methods and will go over a few well-known methods. The specific learning outcomes are:

* Understand the basic principles for cost allocation;
* Overview the three paradigms for cost allocation;
* Learn/Recap DC Power Flow Analysis.
* Explore 4 embedded cost method: Postage Stamp, MW-mile, Modulus and Zero Counterflow;
* Explore 1 incremental cost method: ICRP;
* Understand the revenue reconciliation process and why some of these methods will not recover the entire required revenue;
* Apply all these methods to a case study.
