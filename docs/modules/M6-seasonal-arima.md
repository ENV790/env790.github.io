## Learning Objectives

In this module we will discuss how increased renewable energy penetration will pose new challenges to operation and scheduling of power plants. The learning outcomes of this module are:

* Understand the economic dispatch problem definition;
* Understand the challenged posed by renewables and storage - how present decisions impact future cost and increased uncertainty;
* Discuss ways to handle uncertainty in decision problems;
* Formulate the stochastic hydro-thermal scheduling problem (HTSP).
